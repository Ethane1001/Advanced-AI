# Advanced-AI 
This AI program uses the OpenNLP library to perform natural language processing and machine learning to categorize user inputs and generate appropriate responses. The program loads a pre-trained document categorizer model and a set of pre-defined responses from a properties file.

The program starts by greeting the user and asking for their name. It then waits for user input and uses OpenNLP to categorize the input into a specific category, such as "greeting", "question", or "farewell". The program then uses the category to select an appropriate response from the pre-defined responses.

The program can continue the conversation with the user until the user types "exit" to end the conversation.

This is just a more advanced example, and there are many other ways to build advanced AI systems in Java using various libraries and frameworks.
